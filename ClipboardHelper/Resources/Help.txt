1. Introduction
---------------

CLIPBOARD HELPER REGEX can automatically detect if text changes in Windows Clipboard. It can display a list of selectable texts depending
on which new text is in the Clipboard. The selected text is then automatically set in to the Clipboard for pasting later. Regular expressions
are used to match specific new text content in the Clipboard with a specific list.


2. Requirements
---------------

-Windows 10.
-Microsoft Net framework 4.8
-Older Windows can function but hasn't been tested.


3. How it Works
---------------

-Can monitor Windows Clipboard for changes.
-If there is a new text in the Clipboard, the program tries to match the Clipboard text with a list of predefined (Reg)ular (Ex)pressions.
-If any of the defined RegEx can match the new text in the Clipboard, a list of predefined selectable texts is shown. 
-When line(s) of text in the list is/are selected, it's copied to the Clipboard where it can be pasted to other programs.
-Every list has a specific Regular Expression that determines when that specific list is shown.
-If the program can't match any RegEx with a new text in Clipboard, then nothing happens.


4. Features
---------------

-Can select multiple lines of texts with Mouse, CTRL and SHIFT (as selecting files in Explorer). This can be ideal when pasting
 multiple commands to console windows with CTRL+V. 
-Shows which text is in Clipboard now.
-Automatically start upon Windows boot.
-Deactivate program. When deactivated it won't listen Clipboard for changes.
-Main window can be automatically closed, minimized or remain visible after a text has been selected.
-Set the number of seconds the main window remain visible after selecting a text in the list.
-Main window can be closed instantly or slowly faded.
-Main window can be set to be focused when shown.
-Main window can be shown in three ways: Program matches Clipboard with RegEx, by selecting "Show" in the icon menu
 or with predefined short cut keys.
-Set a combination of shortcut keys (CTRL, ALT, SHIFT, WIN and A to Z) to show the main program window when pressed.
-Change the default line selection color and some other color settings.
-Can hold one secret and secure password which can be used when selecting texts and pasting. This is helpful when logging in to places. 
 The stored password is securely stored in Windows Credential Manager.
-Prompt for username and password when requesting Json data which is password protected. This login information can be 
 securely stored in Windows Credential Manager.
-Alternative pasting method. Ability to paste in console programs which usually doesn't support pasting with CTRL+V. This set of programs
 can be changed in the settings. The pre stored programs are: MobaXterm; mRemoteNG; PuTTY; ConEmu64.
-Can be resetted to factory settings in the settings.
-Has two different Tabs, "Auto" and "Manual". The Auto tab can't be renamed. The Manual tab can be renamed in the settings.
-Auto tab can be shown by selecting it with the mouse, keyboard left arrow navigation key or when there is a RegEx match with the Clipboard.
-Auto tab has navigation buttons so it's possible to go backwards in copy history. 
-Manual tab can be shown by selecting it with the mouse or with the keyboard arrow navigation keys when main window is in focus.
-All the saved Auto- and Manual tabs are saved in two settings files: AutoShownTabs.xml and ManuallyShownTabs.xml.
-Ability to quickly replace the programs default AutoShownTabs.xml and ManuallyShownTabs.xml files with new files (in Advanced Settings).
-Advanced ability to control if the replaced the AutoShownTabs.xml or ManuallyShownTabs.xml are valid. 
-Ability to import csv files which data can be shown when program matches with clipboard (in Advanced Settings).
-All lines are numbered.
-All lines can be selected using the keyboard with keys 0-9.
-A line selection can always be aborted by clicking the Escape key. 
-When program system tray icon is left mouse clicked, all formatting is removed from the text currently in Clipboard.

---------------

-When repetative copying and pasting is needed between different programs in Windows.
-Instead of having template texts on Notepad or a text editor, this program can have them easily selectable and easy to paste.


8. Settings
---------------

-Appearance

	-"Fade out and minimize" -> fades out the window and minimizes it.
	-"Fade out and close" -> fades out the window and closes it.	
	-"Minimize" -> minimizes the window instantly.		
	-"Close" -> closes the window instantly.
	-"Seconds" -> number of seconds, after a text selection in the list, before any window closing, minimizing or fading occurs, 
	-"Start program automatically on Windows boot." -> If enabled the program will start on Windows boot.
	-"Focus program when shown." -> Puts the program in focus when its window is shown.	
	-"Show the window with the following key combinations: ctrl alt shift win a to z" -> When these keys are pressed at the same time
		the main program window is shown.
	-"Display text tag; Titel/Info/WebUrlToGo/OutlookSearch/LineSelection in the following color:" -> The default color can be changed
		to any color.
	-"Use the text tag Password() with the following password:" -> The text string Password() can be used in Auto tabs to use the
		password.
	-"Automatically use Console compatible (CMD, MobaXTerm, Putty etc.) pasting [put programs exe name]:" -> When pasting to another program
		and the programs *.exe filename is inserted in the textbox, then it will use an alternative pasting method. This is because
		many console programs don't accept pasting with key combination of CTRL+V, therefore this program solves that issue with
		an alternative pasting method.
	-"Reset to Factory settings" -> Resets all settings to factory default. Note, no Auto- or Manual are removed when reset.

-AutoShownTabs

	-"New" -> Creates a new AutoTab with the provided name.
	-"Delete" -> Deletes the currently selected AutoTab. A warning dialog is shown to prevent unintentional clicks.
	-"Rename" -> Changes the currently selected AutoTab with a new name.
	-"Please edit/insert the RegEx to be associated with:" -> A textbox where the RegEx associated the currently selected AutoTab
		is changed.
	-"When Clipboard content changes and rules make a match, please insert what is shown:" -> A textbox where all the texts that are to
		be shown must be inserted. Different tags can be used to increase functionality. The tags are case sensitive and are:

		-ChangeableContent(content) -> Everything between the parenthesisâ€™s "content" can be changed by the user when using the 
					program. This means its dynamic content.

		-ConsoleOpen(command1; command2; command3; ...) -> When this line is clicked nothing is pasted, instead a PowerShell
					console window is opened and all the commands "command1" "command2" etc. are run automatically. The
					console is opened always on the Windows Desktop folder, but can be changed with command "cd".

		-FromUnixTimeMilliSecondsToUTC(unixTimeStamp; GMTPlusHours) -> "unixTimeStamp" is the Unix time stamp to be 
					converted to a human readable time stamp. "GMTPlusHours" defines how many hours are to be added to
					the shown GMT time. 

		-Info() -> Everything between the parentheses is only informational help text. When the line is selected this text doesn't
					get copied to the Clipboard.
		
		-NewLine() -> This indicates new line. Text is not allowed between the parentheses.

		-Outlook(searchText) -> When the line containing this tag is clicked, then it will automatically focus an already active
					Microsoft Outlook search box and automatically search the mailbox for the "searchText".

		-"Password()" -> The password which is stored in the settings (see 8. Appearance) is pasted when line containing this tag is
					selected. Text is not allowed between the parentheses.

		-Regex(regExString) -> "regExString" string must be a RegEx string which will be matched with what is currently in the
					Clipboard. Result of that match will be shown.

		-Regex(textToMatch; regExString) -> "regExString" string must be a RegEx string which will be matched to "textToMatch". 
					Result of that match will be shown.

		-RegexCsvFileGet(Filename; searchText; ignoreCase) -> Searches the csv file with the filename "Filename" which have been 
					imported earlier (see 8. Advanced) to the program. It is searched for with the "searchText" and if
					"ignoreCase" is set to [true] then the letter casing is ignored when searching the file.

		-RegexReplace(regExPattern; replacement) -> The current Clipboard value is matched with the "regExPattern" and the result
					of the matching is replaced with the "replacement".

		-RegexReplace(text; regExPattern; replacement) -> "text" is matched with the "regExPattern" and the result
					of the matching is replaced with the "replacement"

		-WebGet(URL) -> downloads the "URL" and diplays its text content.

		-WebGetJason(URL; nameOfJasonProperty; toLowerCase) -> Downloads the "URL" and displays "nameOfJasonProperty". If 
					toLowerCase is true, then it's shown in lower case.

		-WebUrlGoTo(URL) -> when the line is clicked it opens the "URL" in the default Windows Web Browser, last active Browser
					window 

-ManuallyShownTabs

	-Tab order -> List with all Manually Shown Tabs. Dragging an item on the list with left mouse, reorders the item. Selecting the
		item with left click, shows the text for that list item on the left. The list on the left is editable. When a list item 
		is left clicked, a menu appears where a new Manual tab can be added, an existing tab can be renamed or an existing tab can be
		deleted.

-Advanced

	-Files added -> Shows the AutoShownTabs.xml and ManuallyShownTabs.xml settings files. These two can't be deleted only replaced
		by left clicking the file and by selecting replace. The program controls if the new file is valid. If not valid the
		new files will be rejected. If the file list is left clicked and add clicked, a new *.csv file can be imported to the
		program. This can be used by Auto Tabs when listing selectable texts. A csv file can also be deleted by selecting 
		"delete" when left clicking the csv file.
